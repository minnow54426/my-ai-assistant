# Episode 1: The Tool System - TypeScript Generics Made Simple

## Introduction

Today I dove into the tool system - the foundation that gives our AI agent its capabilities.

When I started this project, I barely knew TypeScript. I'd used JavaScript before, but TypeScript felt like "JavaScript with extra homework." Concepts like "generics" seemed intimidating - lots of angle brackets and type variables that made my eyes glaze over.

But here's the thing: after building and testing this system, **generics finally clicked for me**.

I remember the moment clearly. I was struggling to understand why the code wasn't working, so I added some debug logging. TypeScript immediately showed me an error: "Property 'message' is missing." I thought, "Wait, TypeScript knows what my tool needs before I even run the code?" That's when it clicked - generics aren't complexity, they're **clarity**.

In this episode, I'll break down how the tool system works, why TypeScript generics are so powerful (and not scary), and what I learned from the bugs I found along the way.

## Background

**What I knew before starting:**
- Basic programming concepts from another language
- JavaScript fundamentals
- What tools were conceptually (functions that do things)

**What I wanted to learn:**
- How to structure tools in TypeScript
- What generics actually are and why they matter
- How to manage a collection of tools
- How to make it type-safe

**What I expected:**
Complex, confusing code with lots of type annotations.

**What I found:**
A simple, elegant system that's actually easier to understand because of TypeScript's type safety.

## Deep Dive

### How It Works

The tool system has two main parts:

**1. The Tool Interface**

Every tool follows this structure:

```typescript
interface Tool<T, R> {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: ToolParameterSchema;
  execute: (params: T) => Promise<R>;
}
```

Let me break this down in simple terms:

- **`name`**: Just a label like "echo" or "get-time" - how we identify the tool
- **`description`**: Human-readable explanation of what the tool does
- **`parameters`**: A JSON Schema describing what inputs the tool needs
- **`execute`**: The actual function that does the work

The magic part is `<T, R>` - these are **generics**.

**2. The ToolRegistry**

This is a simple manager that keeps track of all available tools:

```typescript
class ToolRegistry {
  private tools: Map<string, Tool> = new Map();

  register(tool: Tool): void {
    // Add tool to the Map
  }

  execute(name: string, params: unknown): Promise<unknown> {
    // Find tool and run it
  }
}
```

Think of it like a tool chest - you put tools in it, and later you can ask for a specific tool by name.

### Key Concepts: TypeScript Generics

Before this project, generics scared me. But now I get it!

**Without generics** (what I expected):
```typescript
interface Tool {
  name: string;
  execute: (params: any) => Promise<any>;  // 😕 What type is this?
}
```

**With generics** (what we built):
```typescript
interface Tool<T, R> {
  execute: (params: T) => Promise<R>;  // 😊 Type-safe!
}
```

**Why this matters:**

Generics let us say "This tool takes input of type T and returns type R." TypeScript will then:

1. **Validate the input** - Catch mistakes before code even runs
2. **Know the output type** - Autocomplete works, no surprises
3. **Catch bugs early** - Tests fail if types don't match

**Example:**

```typescript
// Echo tool takes string, returns string
const echoTool: Tool<{ message: string }, string> = {
  execute: async (params) => {
    return `Echo: ${params.message}`;  // ✅ TypeScript knows params.message is a string
  }
};

// File list tool takes config, returns file list
const fileListTool: Tool<{ directory: string }, { files: string[] }> = {
  execute: async (params) => {
    const files = await fs.readdir(params.directory);  // ✅ TypeScript knows params.directory exists
    return { files };
  }
};
```

TypeScript prevents mistakes like:
- Calling `execute({ wrongParam: 5 })` - "Property 'message' is missing"
- Forgetting required parameters - caught before runtime
- Returning wrong type - "Type 'string' is not assignable to type '{ files: string[] }'"

### Code Walkthrough

Let's trace how a tool is used:

```typescript
// Step 1: Create a registry
const tools = new ToolRegistry();

// Step 2: Define a tool with types
const echoTool: Tool<{ message: string }, string> = {
  name: "echo",
  description: "Echoes back the message",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      message: { type: "string", description: "The message to echo back" }
    },
    required: ["message"]
  },
  execute: async (params) => {
    return `Echo: ${params.message}`;
  }
};

// Step 3: Register it
tools.register(echoTool);

// Step 4: Execute it (type-safe!)
const result = await tools.execute("echo", { message: "Hello" });
// TypeScript knows result is a string here! ✅
```

The generics flow:
1. `tools.execute("echo", { message: "Hello" })`
2. TypeScript looks up echo tool: `Tool<{ message: string }, string>`
3. TypeScript checks `{ message: "Hello" }` matches `{ message: string }`
4. TypeScript knows the return type is `string`
5. Autocomplete works! Bugs prevented!

## What I Broke: Learning by Doing

They say "you learn more from mistakes than successes." So I tried to break the tool system in different ways. Here's what happened:

### Experiment 1: What if tool has no name?

```typescript
const badTool: Tool<{}, string> = {
  name: "",  // Empty name
  description: "Bad tool",
  parameters: { type: "object", properties: {}, required: [] },
  execute: async () => "result"
};

tools.register(badTool);  // ✅ This works!
```

**What I learned:** The system doesn't validate tool names. Should it? Maybe, but for now it's fine - empty names would just be confusing to use.

### Experiment 2: What if duplicate tool names?

```typescript
const tool1: Tool<{}, string> = {
  name: "duplicate",
  description: "First tool",
  parameters: { type: "object", properties: {}, required: [] },
  execute: async () => "result1"
};

const tool2: Tool<{}, string> = {
  name: "duplicate",  // Same name
  description: "Second tool",
  parameters: { type: "object", properties: {}, required: [] },
  execute: async () => "result2"
};

tools.register(tool1);
tools.register(tool2);  // ❌ Throws error!
```

**Error:** `Tool already registered: duplicate`

**What I learned:** The registry protects against duplicates. This is good! It prevents accidentally overwriting tools. The error message is clear and helpful.

### Experiment 3: What if I pass wrong parameters?

```typescript
const echoTool: Tool<{ message: string }, string> = {
  execute: async (params) => `Echo: ${params.message}`
};

tools.register(echoTool);

// Try to call with wrong params
await tools.execute("echo", { wrongField: "test" });
```

**What happened:** TypeScript shows a red squiggly even before I run the code!

**Error:** `Property 'message' is missing in type '{ wrongField: string }' but required in type '{ message: string }'`

**What I learned:** Generics catch bugs **at compile time**, not at runtime. This is huge! I can't accidentally pass wrong parameters - TypeScript stops me before the code even runs.

### Experiment 4: What if tool doesn't exist?

```typescript
await tools.execute("non-existent", {});
```

**Error:** `Tool not found: non-existent`

**What I learned:** The registry throws a clear error when a tool doesn't exist. This makes debugging easy - I immediately know the problem.

## Real Bugs I Encountered

During development, I hit several bugs that taught me important lessons:

### Bug #1: The Regex That Broke Tool Detection

**The Problem:**
When I first tested the agent, it wouldn't use the `get-time` tool. The LLM would say "Using tool: get-time with params: {}" but nothing happened!

**The Investigation:**
I added debug logging to trace what was happening:
```typescript
console.log('[DEBUG] LLM Response:', response.content);
// Output: "Using tool: get-time with params: {}"
console.log('[DEBUG] Tool call detected:', toolCall);
// Output: undefined
```

The tool call was returning `undefined`!

**The Bug:**
```typescript
// In executor.ts, the parsing regex:
const toolPattern = /Using tool:\s*(\w+)\s+with params:\s*(\{.*\})/i;
```

`\w+` matches word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _) but **not hyphens!**

So tool names like `get-time` and `file-list` were never detected.

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// Changed to:
const toolPattern = /Using tool:\s*([\w-]+)\s+with params:\s*(\{.*\})/i;
//                            ^^^^^^ Added hyphen support
```

**Lesson:** Always test your regex patterns with your actual data, not made-up examples!

### Bug #2: The Timezone Confusion

**The Problem:**
The agent showed UTC time but I'm in Beijing (UTC+8). When I asked "What time is it?", it showed 1:41 AM but it was actually 9:41 AM!

**The Investigation:**
```typescript
// Original code:
return new Date().toISOString();  // Returns UTC
// Output: "2026-02-21T01:41:00.000Z"
```

**The Fix:**
```typescript
const now = new Date();
// Add 8 hours for Beijing time (UTC+8)
const beijingTime = new Date(now.getTime() + (8 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
return beijingTime.toISOString().replace('Z', '') + ' (Beijing Time, UTC+8)';
```

**Lesson:** Always consider timezone! Users expect their local time, not UTC.

### Bug #3: The File-List That Found Nothing

**The Problem:**
I asked the agent to "List TypeScript files in src" and it said: "I don't see any TypeScript files... The directory appears to be empty."

But I knew there were 17 `.ts` files!

**The Investigation:**
```typescript
// Tool was only looking at top-level directory
const entries = await fs.readdir(targetDir, { withFileTypes: true });
let files = entries
  .filter((entry) => entry.isFile())
  .map((entry) => entry.name);
```

The `.ts` files were in subdirectories: `src/agent/`, `src/llm/`, etc.

**The Fix:**
Made the search recursive by default:
```typescript
if (recursive) {
  // Recurse into all subdirectories
  const getAllFiles = async (dir: string, baseDir: string) => {
    const entries = await fs.readdir(dir, { withFileTypes: true });
    for (const entry of entries) {
      if (entry.isDirectory()) {
        await getAllFiles(fullPath, baseDir);  // Recurse!
      } else if (entry.isFile()) {
        files.push(relativePath);
      }
    }
  };
}
```

**Lesson:** When working with file systems, think about directory structures!

## Key Takeaways

After breaking and studying the tool system, here's what stuck:

1. **Generics aren't scary** - They're just placeholders for types. Think: "This takes type T, returns type R" - simple as that.

2. **Type safety prevents bugs** - I can't pass wrong parameters or misinterpret return values. TypeScript catches mistakes before I even run the code.

3. **The Map is perfect for registries** - Using a Map to store tools is simple and efficient. Built-in methods like `has()`, `get()`, and `set()` do everything we need.

4. **Async tools are natural** - All tools are async (`execute: async (params) => Promise<R>`). This makes sense because tools might do I/O operations (like reading files).

5. **Simple structure works** - The tool interface only has 4 fields, but it's powerful enough for anything we need. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - keep it simple!

## Code Evolution: What Changed from Initial Design

**First thought:** Use TypeBox for schema validation (like OpenClaw does)
**Final code:** Simple JSON Schema object
**Why?** TypeBox was overkill for what we need. Simple JSON Schema is enough.

**First thought:** Complex tool validation
**Final code:** Just check if tool name already exists
**Why?** Keep it simple. The agent is responsible for using tools correctly.

**First thought:** Separate validation logic
**Final code:** Let TypeScript handle it
**Why?** TypeScript's type system already validates. No need to duplicate effort.

## What Surprised Me

1. **How simple the registry is** - It's just a Map! No complex logic needed. I expected something much more complicated.

2. **TypeScript generics make sense now** - I used to think they were complex, but they're just type placeholders. My "aha!" moment was when I saw TypeScript catch a bug before I even ran the code - that's when it clicked.

3. **The tests were easy to write** - Because the types are clear, I knew exactly what to test. I wrote the test first, watched it fail (the "RED" phase), then wrote the code. It felt strange at first, but it actually worked!

4. **Async is default** - Everything is async. This feels natural for I/O operations. I don't even think about it anymore.

5. **TDD actually worked** - Writing tests first helped me understand the interface before implementing. It prevented me from going down wrong paths.

6. **Bugs were teaching moments** - Each bug I fixed taught me something important: regex matching, timezones, directory traversal. I learned more from fixing bugs than from writing perfect code the first time.

7. **It took less time than expected** - I built the whole tool system in about 4-6 hours, including tests. I thought it would take days!

## Next Steps

The tool system is the foundation - it defines what our agent CAN do. But something needs to decide WHEN to use each tool.

**Coming in Episode 2:** I'll dive into the three tools I built (echo, get-time, file-list), including:
- How I made get-time work for Beijing timezone
- The bug in file-list pattern matching
- What I learned about error handling

**Episode 3 Preview:** Then we'll look at the Agent Executor - the "brain" that decides which tool to use and how to communicate with the GLM API.
