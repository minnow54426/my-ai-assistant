# Task Plan: Phase 2 - Blog-Driven Deep Study

## Goal
Deeply understand each agent component by writing blog posts about what I learned. Each blog post forces me to teach the material, solidifying my understanding.

## Current Phase
Phase 2: Deep Study

## Phases

### Phase 2.1: Tool System (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Study Tool interface and generics
- [ ] Study ToolRegistry implementation
- [ ] Break: What if tool has no name?
- [ ] Break: What if duplicate tool names?
- [ ] Break: What if invalid tool calls?
- [ ] Write Episode 1: Tool System
- [ ] Get review and revise
- [ ] Study built-in tools (echo, get-time, file-list)
- [ ] Break: Tool error handling
- [ ] Break: Pattern matching edge cases
- [ ] Write Episode 2: Building Tools
- [ ] Get review and revise
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 2.2: Agent Executor (Day 3)
- [ ] Study AgentExecutor class
- [ ] Study processMessage flow
- [ ] Study tool call parsing
- [ ] Break: What if LLM returns invalid JSON?
- [ ] Break: What if tool execution fails?
- [ ] Write Episode 3: Agent "Brain"
- [ ] Get review and revise
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 2.3: Message Flow & Architecture (Day 4)
- [ ] Trace full message flow
- [ ] Study all component integration
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Break: What if empty message?
- [ ] Break: What if LLM timeout?
- [ ] Write Episode 4: Message Flow
- [ ] Get review and revise
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 2.4: LLM Integration (Day 5)
- [ ] Study GLM client implementation
- [ ] Study API integration patterns
- [ ] Study Beijing time conversion
- [ ] Break: What if API key wrong?
- [ ] Break: What if API returns error?
- [ ] Write Episode 5: LLM Integration
- [ ] Get review and revise
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 2.5: Summary & Architecture (Day 6)
- [ ] Review all components
- [ ] Create complete architecture diagram
- [ ] Write Episode 6: Summary
- [ ] Update findings.md
- [ ] Update progress.md
- [ ] Create Phase 3 readiness checklist
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
1. Can I explain each component without looking at the code?
2. Can I draw the architecture from memory?
3. Do I understand the TypeScript concepts used?
4. Can I rebuild from scratch?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Write blog posts to learn | Teaching reinforces learning (Feynman technique) |
| One component per day | Manageable chunks, deep focus |
| Get reviews after each post | Catch misunderstandings early |
| Include "What I Broke" section | Experiments reveal true understanding |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| | 1 | |

## Notes
- Update phase status as you progress
- Re-read this plan before major decisions
- Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
- Focus on explaining simply (beginner-friendly)
